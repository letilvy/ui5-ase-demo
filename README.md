Greeter
Before you start:
Try not to read ahead.
Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
This kata demonstrates the problems of static scoped functions and objects.

All tests should always pass, regardless of environment conditions.

Write a Greeter class with greet function that receives a name as input and outputs Hello <name>. The signature of greet should not change throughout the kata. You are allowed to construct Greeter object as you please.
greet trims the input

greet returns Good morning <name> when the time is 06:00-12:00
greet returns Good evening <name> when the time is 18:00-22:00
greet returns Good night <name> when the time is 22:00-06:00
